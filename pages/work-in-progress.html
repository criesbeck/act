<div>
  <strong>Work in progress</strong> (WIP): the number of stories
  in the "doing" column of a 
  <a href="#task-board">task board</a>.
</div>

<div>
  Minimize WIP. It is far better to have two stories
  done than four stories half done. Risk is reduced
  and user testing can begin earlier.
</div>

<div>
  To minimize WIP, developers gang up on stories. 
  When a developer finishes one story,
  she first sees if developers on another story
  need help. This leads to a better bus factor.
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Bus factor<strong>: the number of developers
  that would need to get hit by a bus to kill
  your project. If one developer is essential, that's bad.
  If every developer is essential, that's the worst.
</div>
