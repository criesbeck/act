<div>
  A task scenario is a situation to put test users into,
  that will tell you what you need to know about your
  app's perceived value and usabiity. Your 
  <a href="#4-panel-storyboard">4-panel storyboard</a>
  is a good starting point for what should be in your
  first task scenario.     
</div>

<div>
  Task scenarios should be written, not explained.
  "You've been working
  on your home computer for two hours. You'd like to get in a ten 
  minutes of moderate exercise. Time to use the <strong>WorkIt!</strong>
  trainer app!"    
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Do not</strong> give users instructions on how to solve the problem. If 
  your app needs a manual, redesign.     
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Do not</strong> test by showing your app to
  possible users and asking "what do you think?" This tells you 
  anything about whether the app actually might have user value.
</div>

<div>
  Prepare a short list of post-task questions to ask, such as "what were the 
  three most confusing things?" and "what worked best?" Prepare an even
  shorter list of pre-task quesions to ask, relevant to locating this
  user in your target market, e.g., "how often do you exercise?"
