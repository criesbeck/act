  Swarming is when a team works together, typically in the same location
  at the same time, to complete a single user story at a time. Complete, as usual,
  means code, test, and deploy.
</div>

<div>
  Swarms usually last for two to three hours, and occur several times a week.
  The best swarming environment has a large table everyone can sit at,
  a large whiteboard for sketches
  and notes, and a large screen display, to show the application as
  it changes, error messages, and so on.

<div>
  Swarming minimizes work in progress (WIP),
  maximizes team knowledge of the entire codebase,
  maximizes team input into the design process, and
  bonds the team together.

  Both clients and developers often believe that "divide and conquer"
  means every developer should work on a different task.
  You don't divide the team, you divide the problem. As client, you should divide the problem into
  valuable <a href="#vertical-slice">slices</a>. Ideally, a slice is small
  enough to be done in one swarm. If the slice is complex enough,
  the developers will divide it into subtasks.

  The most successful teams in my software development courses have
  been those that do virtually all their development in swarms. The
  teams that have faced the most challenges in satisfying their
  clients have been those that did most development
  individually.

  <em>Pairing</em> is when two developers work together on
  a coding task, with just one keyboard. The developers take
  turns "driving", i.e., typing, and "navigating", i.e., 
  thinking about test cases, possible bugs, alternative approaches,
  etc.
</div>

<div>
  <em>Mobbing</em> is when the team works on a story, as in a swarm,
  but with just one keyboard, as in pairing.
