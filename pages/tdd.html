  Test-driven development is one of the earliest practices in agile.
  The idea is a simple but radical reversal of traditional practice.
  It is seen mostly in mature agile development teams.

<div>
  How test-driven development (TDD) develops code:
  <ol>
    <li>First, write code that will test the code you plan to write.</li>
    <li>Run those tests to verify that things don't work yet.</li>
    <li>Write just enough application code to pass all the tests.</li>
    <li>Go back to the first step.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div>
  <em>Writing the tests before the code</em>, in Step 1,
  leads developers to think more carefully about exactly what the code
  should do. Ambiguities and vagueness in the requirements
  are found while writing tests, before any application code is created.
</div>

<div>
  <em>Running the new tests before writing any new code</em> in Step 2
  is necessary to ensure that the testing code work. Testing code
  is just as likely to have bugs as applicatin code.
</div>

<div>
  <em>Running all the tests</em> in Step 3, not just the new ones, is
  necessary to ensure new code doesn't
  break what used to work.
</div>

<div>
  <em>Writing just enough application code</em> to pass the tests and no more,
  in Step 4, is necessary to ensure that 
  all application code has testing code associated with it.
</div>

<div>
  TDD naturally
  leads developer to write code that is easier to test. Easy to test code turns
  out to be more maintainable code.
</div>

<div>
  TDD resolves a number of major psychological barriers to thorough code testing with
  traditional code-then-test methods.
  <ul>
    <li>No end of iteration time pressure to short-change test development </li>
    <li>No effort or ego investment in any application code to reduce incentive to write hard tests</li>
    <li>No reason to feel bad when tests fail at the start, since
      there's no code yet</li>
  </ul>
