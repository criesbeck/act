  Estimates for when a software project will finish are
  notorious for being wrong by a factor of two or more.
  <a href="#velocity">Velocity</a> can provide
  more realistic, data-based estimates.

  What follows is a toy example to demonstrate
  velocity math. You should first
  look at how the same situation would be
  handled by <a href="#gantt-math">Gantt math</a>.

  The developers split the user stories up, until they
  are what they think are one-day efforts. They
  end up with 20 stories, each one point.
  Over previous projects, the developer team's average
  velocity was 5 points per week, so that's the 
  initial guess. At that velocity, taking weekends into account,
  the project should finish by April 22nd.

<div>
  After the first full week of development, the developers
  finished 4 points of stories. Now they use velocity math
  to predict when the project might complete, using
  a <a href="#burndown-chart">burndown chart</a>.

<div>
  With an actual velocity of 4 points per week, the
  prediction is obvious. The project will take 5 iterations.
  It will finish on April 29.
