  The Kano model separates product functionality into <em>delighters</em>,
  <em>performance items</em> and <em>must-haves</em>.
  Customers won't buy your product unless it includes
  the must-haves, and meets expected performance standards.

  useful when deciding what to build

  care about the must-haves.
