<div>
  Story points on user stories are estimates of <em>relative</em>
  expected effort. They are relative in that a user story with two points
  is estimated to be twice as hard as a story with one point.
</div>

<div>
  Story points are assigned by developers, as a team exercise. 
  Developers determine 
  <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/3-powerful-estimation-techniques-for-agile-teams/">which method</a> works well enough for them, with the least effort.
</div>

<div>
  Story points do not predict how long things will take. 
  That's what <a href="#velocity">velocity</a> is for. Velocity
  is calculated after several iterations have occurred. Any
  estimates of time before then are pure guesswork.
</div>

<div>
  Some agile teams do not use story points. Instead, they 
  slice all stories 
  until they are small and equivalent in size. Then 
  velocity is simply the number of stories done per iteration.
