<div>
  A scenario canvas combines a 
  <a href="#scenario">scenario</a>
  with the 
  <a href="#user-story">user stories</a>
  required to support it.
</div> 

<div>
  A scenario canvas provides critical context
  for properly understanding and implement
  the user stories. The canvas is a more coherent,
  richer alternative 
  to adding an "in order to [accomplish goal]"
  phrase to each story. 
</div>

<div>
  Prioritize stories
  by the scenarios they complete. Prioritize
  scenarios by the hypothesis testing, demoes,
  and viable releases they enable. 
  <br>
  Within a scenario, do the payoff first.
