  Up-front estimation of project length is not an agile practice.
  The development of new kinds of software, where agile is most often
  used, simply has too many unknowns. 
  Only very cut and dried projects involving primarily software
  configuration and customization are predictable. 
</div>

<div>
  The problem with project estimates are that they are made 
  when the least amount of information is known about the product,
  the development team, the users, and the competitive environment.
  Worse, what developers offer as a helpful guess
  is interpreted by the client as a promise to deliver. 
</div>

<div>
  Why do clients need estimates? To budget and to plan.
  How much money will be spent? When will we get what we're paying for?
  But you can't answer a need with a fiction like
  a fixed price, fixed scope contract.
</div>

<div>
  The agile approach is to restructure the project. 
  Don't create a 12-month project to build a complex package
  for managing and tracking mentoring of new hires. Define a useful,
  high value piece of software that can be delivered in a month, e.g.,
  a mentor / new hire signup site. Deploy and use. While gathering
  feedback, define a follow-on package to deploy the next month. And so on.
</div>

<div>
  Budget for 6 months of deliverables. What will be wanted
  and delivered in later months will be informed
  by what's learned from usage of the first deliverables.
  Negotiate a process for renewal of the contract until 
  diminishing returns occur, or more important needs arise.

  Once an agile project is underway, you start
  getting data that can help better track progress and forecast
  whats doable in any given timeframe.

<div>
  Some organizations like to track bug statistics. How often 
  do they arise, who discovers them (clients, test users, or
  end users), how long do they take to fix? Rises
  in bug rates or time to fix suggest a topic for the next
  <a href="#retrospective">retrospective</a>.
</div>

<div>
  Instead of tracking bugs, many agile teams recommend
  making bugs very painful. If a bug
  is uncovered, they
  freeze all further changes to the code base, 
  until it is fixed. This prevents the accumulation
  of unfixed bugs. If stoppages due to bugs become frequent,
  developers are forced to retrospect on how to improved
  the quality of their coding and testing processes.
