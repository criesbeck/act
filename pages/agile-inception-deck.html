<div>
  The agile inception deck is a handful of slides to prepare
  in advance and share with your developers. 
  Less is more. A few slides, not a hundred pages
  of requirements. The goal is to enlighten, no overwhelm.
</div>

<div>
  Exactly what slides to use are up to you, but my recommendations
  are to include the following:
  <ul>
    <li>a <a href="#4-panel-storyboard">4-panel storyboard</a></li>
    <li>a <a href="#product-box">product box</a></li>
    <li>a <a href="#use-case-diagram">use case diagram</a> or
      similar stakeholders slide
    </li>
    <li>a "what keeps us up at night"</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  The original description of an agile inception deck appeared
  on the 
  <a href="https://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/the-agile-inception-deck/">
  Agile Samurai website</a>. I recommend deferring scope discussions
  until later, and deferring architecture decisions to the developers.
