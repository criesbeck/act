  The template format for a user story is  "<strong>A [type of user]
  can [interact with the product] in order to [achieve some goal].</strong>"
</div>

<div>
  The user story is the basic unit of work and progress
  in agile. A user story
  is not about what code gets written, but what
  goal a user will be able to accomplish.

<div>
  A user story is not a requirement. It is just a token for future
  conversation about the real requirement. 
</div>

<div>
  A user story is not a scenario. A user story is short, typically one
  sentence. A user story is focused on one goal. A user
  story is defined for a role, not a persona.
</div>

<div>
  Ironically, most user stories should not use the word "user". "User"
  is too vague and ambiguous. Most products are used by people with specific
  roles, e.g., players, buyers, sellers, authors, editors, and so on. Different
  roles have different needs.

<div>
  A commonly recommended user story template
  is "<strong>As a </strong><em>type of user</em><strong>, I
  can </strong><em>do something</em><strong>
  in order to </strong><em>achieve some goal</em><strong>.</strong>"
  The goal makes all the difference. "As a buyer, I can sort
  a list of products." Sort how? By price? By rating? By popularity? It all
  depends on "why".
