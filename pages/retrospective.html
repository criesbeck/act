<div>
  Retrospectives are meetings held frequently to improve the development
  process by identifying and analyzing the causes of recurrent 
  issues. 
</div>

<div>
  As with everything else in agile, small and frequent retrospectives
  are better than infrequent project post-mortems. A common approach is 
  to hold a small retrospective at the end of every iteration.

  The goal is process change.
  "Do better" is not a process change. It's just a goal. A process
  change is a simple, clear, change in the steps in the current process,
  e.g., a reordering of steps, the addition or deletion of a step, or the
  automation of a step.
</div>

<div>
  A process change needs to be clear enough that you can tell if
  it's being done. Not well-defined: 
  "Each coder explains his new code to the other developers"
  Well-defined: "Each code commit message
  includes the name of the user story it is relevant to."
</div>

<div>
  A process change needs a clear metric being improved.
  Not a clear metric: "Everyone understands the code base." 
  A clear metric: "Every developer appears in the commit log for
  every code file."
</div>

<div>
  Ultimately, a process change needs to lead to improvement
  in one or more <a href="#metrics-that-matter">metrics that matters</a>. 
  Not a metric that matters: 
  "Number of people late for meetings." A metric that matters: 
  "Number of bugs that cause users to lose any data."
