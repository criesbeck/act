<div>
  A vertical slice means that the developers implement all
  the pieces of an end-to-end 
  <em>working</em> prototype, from the front-end user interface all
  the way to back-end.
</div>

<div>
  Developing vertical slices rather than user interface
  mockups reduces risk by identifying possible show stoppers
  in the planned solution, and providing more realistic data on developer
  velocity.

  As Ron Jeffries has said, "End to end is further than you think."

<div>
  <p>In early development of a product that needs to make calls
  to a network or external database, it's usually better
  to use canned data
  in slices, rather
  than making live calls. Canned data is quicker to 
  set up, faster to access during 
  <a href="#unit-testing">unit testing</a>, and easier to work with
  during debugging. 
  </p>
  <p>Canned data though should be real data, scraped from
  the actual sources you will eventually use. Do not
  make up data. Fake data in a demo kills believability. Fake
  data maintains developer misconceptions about what the data
  really looks like.
