  Early user testing is not about whether your prototype works.
  It's about whether your value proposition works.
</div>

<div>
  Decide what you want to learn. The best
  time is when you 
  <a href="#story-expansion">define stories</a> with
  your developers, so that they build what you need to 
  test, and no more.
</div>


<div>
  The secret to effective, consistent user testing: 
  <ul>
    <li>Plan ahead.</li>
    <li>Then shut up and watch.</li>
  </ul>
</div> 
 
<div>
  Prepare just enough written materials to
  learn that, including
  <ul>
    <li>the <a href="#task-scenario">task scenario</a>
       that tests what users can do and whether
      they want to do it
    </li>
    <li>the <a href="#product-box">product box</a> that describes what you're offering</li>
    <li>surveys to give before and after they do the task</li> 
  </ul>  
</div>

<div>
  Come test time, give them the pre-test survey, then hand them the product box
  and the task scenario. <strong>Do not</strong> explain or give instructions. Answer
  questions with another question.
  "Well, what do you think you could do now?" "What do you think will happen
  if you click that?"  When they're done, hand them the post-test survey.
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Pre-test survey</strong>: 
  Just a few questions to locate the user's relevance
  to possible markets: "How often do you ...?" 
  "What do you use to ...?" A minute or two to answer the complete
  survey, at most. 
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Post-test survey</strong>: 
  Five minutes at most of important questions. Optional
  questions OK for those who got into your app. "What three things
  confused you most?" "What parts worked best?" "What would you call this
  kind of an app?" "What apps does it remind you of?"
</div>

<div>
  "Did you like the app?" is not a good test of whether they're interested. Try
  "Would you be willing to test the next version?"
