<div>
  <strong>Velocity</strong>: the number of 
  <a href="#story-point">story points</a> done in an iteration.
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Example</strong> A team completes one three-point story 
  and two five-point stories. The velocity for that iteration
  is 13.
</div>

<div>
  Velocity is the basis for what to expect in an iteration. 
  It can be used in a 
  <a href="#burnup-chart">burnup chart</a>
  to determine when rescoping is needed.
</div>

<div>
  No partial credit. No story points are earned until the story
  is complete, tested, accepted by the client, and deployable
  to users. 
</div>

<div>
  Expect erratic velocities for the first few iterations of a new
  project or a new team. Velocity should stabilize. Whether
  it increases or not depends on many factors. The team will
  become more familiar with the project and technologies, but the
  codebase will become bigger and more complex. 
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Don't calculate an average velocity.</strong>
  The best predictor of the velocity in the next iteration
  is the velocity for the current iteration. If things have slowed,
  there is a reason that probably will persist. This is called
  the "yesterday's weather" model of predicting velocity. 
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Don't compare velocities across teams or projects.</strong> 
  Story points are relative to the
  easiest task in a specific backlog.  
</div>
