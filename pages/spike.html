  A spike is a time-boxed coding task by the developers,
  to determine the feasibility or difficulty
  of solving a specific technical requirement. 
</div>

<div>
  A spike is typically proposed by the development team
  when they find they are unable to estimate 
  <a href="#story-point">how hard a user story is.</a>
</div>

<div>
  For example, a team may unsure how much effort it will
  take to implement credit card payment processing, because
  they've never done it before. So they propose a 
  two-day spike that will involve downloading and
  testing sample code found online for doing credit
  card processing.
</div>

<div>
  A spike is not a <a href="#vertical-slice">slice</a>.
  A spike does not produce code
  for the end product. It produces an improved
  estimate by the developers on how to proceed
  with product design and implementation. 
</div>

<div>
  A spike does not produce end user value. It 
  provides business value by reducing product
  technical risk, 
  and developing the team's technical skills.
</div>

<div>
  Technical spikes are an "advice and consent" situation.
  The team advises when a spike may be important, and
  proposes a time-box for exploration. 
  The client determines when, if ever, to do the spike,
  based on business needs. For example, a payment processing
  spike is not worth doing until you know you have
  an app people in which to embed payment processing.
