  If you can't make your deadline, you could change the deadline.

  <p>For many projects, changing deadlines is not an option.
    For other projects, the costs are high, even if just in terms
    of reputation and developer morale. If this has to be done,
    it should happen as early as possible, to manage everyone's
    expectations. But if the problem is recognized early, there
    are other options.</p>
