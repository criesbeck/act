<em>Agile is a contact sport.</em> 
You can't hand
developers a pile of requirements, and come back some months
later to pick up your software application. Vision, design,
implementation, and testing evolve together.
</div>

<div>
  Each iteration should touch every aspect of the product development
  process, from design, to implementation, to testing, to learning,
  and new design.
</div>

<div>
  Different resources play different roles at different times.
  The <a href="#agile-inception-deck">inception deck</a> kicks things off. 
  The <a href="#backlog">backlog</a> is the channel that connects the
  client's user experience goals with the developer's next tasks.
  The <a href="#vertical-slice">testable slices</a> provide the
  prototypes for testing and learning.
</div>

<div>
  Early agile recommended two to four week iterations, rather
  than months. This was considered extreme at that time.
  But it became clear that those cycles
  were not too short, they were too long. One and two week cycles are
  the norm. Many mature development organizations work in days or
  minutes.
</div>

<div>
  Use product roadmaps, painted in broad strokes, to help maintain
  a coherent vision over frequent iterations.
