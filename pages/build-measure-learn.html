  The
  <strong>Build-Measure-Learn</strong> loop 
  should be faster than you think is possible.
  Undergraduates in my agile development course, with three or four other courses,
  a brand new idea, and unfamiliar technologies, are still
  able deliver a user-testable
  slice in the first week. Companies like Facebook, Google, and WordPress, 
  with mature full-time teams, cycle from concept to initial measures of impact
  within a few days.

<div>
  The starting point
  in <strong>Build-Measure-Learn</strong> is <strong>Learn</strong>.
  What is the next thing you need to know about your product?
  Have the developers build just enough to find out.

  This is why the recommended approach to 
  <a href="#story-expansion">expanding stories for development</a>
  includes defining the 
  <a href="#user-testing">user testing</a> before implementation.

<div>
  Build working prototypes, not mockups.
  Mockups are vaporware. Mockups can test if an interface is
  unusable or confusing, but not if an app in real use is low value 
  or fragile.

<div>
  The big unknown in most apps is whether users will want your app more than
  what they already have. In 
  <a href="#kano-model">Kano model of product features</a> terms,
  this means what matters are your
  <em>delighters</em>, not the must-haves. Users already have
  apps with the must-have parts. Will your delighters
  actually make a difference? Test that first.
