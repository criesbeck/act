  <figcaption>Vision to First Slice</figcaption>

<div>
  Your goal for the first meeting is to make sure the developers understand
  two critical things: one big and broad, and one tiny and specific. 
  The big thing is WHY you
  want something built. What's the point? The tiny thing is WHAT 
  to build first. What has to be tested first?</p>
</div>

<div>
  A useful tool for communicating the big point is
  an <a href="#agile-inception-deck">agile inception deck</a>
  with half a dozen slides that say
  not only WHAT your application is, but WHO it is for,
  and WHY they need it.
</div>

<div>
  The secret to nailing down what to build first 
  is to start with the payoff screen in panel 3
  of the 
  <a href="#4-panel-storyboard">4-panel storyboard</a>,
  where the app shows the user
  something useful or fun. Implement just that screen
  first, to test feasibility and market viability.
</div>

<div>
  To avoid making promises you and the developers can't keep,
  do not mockup the payoff screen. 
  Implement a working 
  <a href="#vertical-slice">vertical slice</a>, with
  the minimal code needed at every level, from user interface to backend database,
  to make the payoff screen real.
</div>

<div>
  Be aggressive in timeline. In my courses, clients, working
  with part-time student
  developers, are required to have a testable slice in 
  one week. No exceptions. 
</div>

<div>
  The users are real. The product is not.
  Spend more time making sure the developers understand your target users.
  Where will they use the application, what are they used to already,
  what do they love and hate about computers, and so on.
</div>
