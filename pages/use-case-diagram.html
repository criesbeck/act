<div>
  Use this to sketch a top-level view of your primary user types and 
  their primary user stories.
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Example:</strong> A marketplace app has
  <strong>buyers</strong>
  and <strong>sellers</strong>. 
  A buyer has stories
  such as browsing, comparing, ordering, saving profile information, and so on. 
  A seller has stories about
  managing a catalog of offerings, tracking views, order, and accounts, and so on.
</div>

<div>
  Assume there are more types of users than you first think.
  For example, buyers and sellers aren't the only users that 
  interact with a marketplace app. There are sysadmins, who
  have stories about real-time monitoring of system traffic and server load,
  managing and backing up data, and so on. There are 
  those in the organization tasked with getting data
  about what's selling, when, to whom. There
  are payment services that have to interact with
  the back-end of your application.
