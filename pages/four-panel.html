<div>
  In at most 4 panels tell a specific story about your app. Two panels for context, persona, and problem,
  two panels for payoff and wrapup.
</div>

<div>
  Panel 3 is the most important. Start there. 
  Show the screenshot that demonstrates your application at its best. 
  Then work backwards to set up a convincing story. Iterate. Test it
  on people. 
</div>

<div>
  The 4-panel is the first test of your idea and whether you are ready to start.

  Do your developers think they can build it? 
  Are your potential customers excited by the story?
</div>

<div>
  Details are critical. They make a story work. 
  "Mary, a freshman in Calculus 102, nervous about the midterm in 3 days"
  not "A student needs a tutor.

<div>
  <p>Skip the friction. Don't get into logging in, menu selection, or a list
    of data entry steps.
