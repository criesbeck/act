<div>
  In at most 4 panels tell a specific story about your app. Two panels for context, persona, and problem,
  two panels for payoff and wrapup.
</div>

<div>
  Panel 3 is the most important. Start there. 
  Show the screenshot that demonstrates your application at its best. 
  Then work backwards to set up a convincing story. Iterate. Test it
  on people. 
</div>

<div>The 4-panel is the acid test of whether you are ready to start.  If you can't 
come up with a realistic example, maybe it doesn't exist. If your story 
doesn't sell the idea, maybe the idea is not that great.
If you can't write a specific example, your developers can't write the code you need.
</div>

<div>
  Sweat the details. They're what make stories work. 
  "Mary, a freshman in Calculus 102, nervous about the midterm in 3 days"
  not "A student needs a tutor.
</div>

<div>
  <p>Skip the friction. Don't get into logging in, menu selection, and stuff like that.
