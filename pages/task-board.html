<div>
  The task board is a visual display of the state of the current iteration.
  The board is divided left to right into at least three columns: 
  ready to do, done, and ready for review.
</div>

<div>
  Frequently, related items, such as the
  <a href="#burnup-chart">burnup chart</a>, are 
  attached to the task board
</div>

<div>
  At the start of the iteration, a card or sticky note
  for each story that was expanded in the
  <a href="#iteration-planning">iteration planning session</a>
  is placed in the ready to do column. A brief summary of the user story
  is written on the card.
</div> 

<div>
  When developers start work on the next story in ready to do, 
  they put their names on the card, and move it into the doing column.
</div>

<div>
  When developers finish a story, i.e., their code
  passes the <a href="#acceptance-test">acceptance tests</a>
  and any unit tests
  created during <a href="#tdd">test-driven development</a>, they move
  the card into the ready to review column.
