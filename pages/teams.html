  Software projects succeed or fail because of people, not materials or manufacturing
  capacity. Fear that the product will fail because of the developers can lead
  clients to a number of destructive responses: micromanagement, detailed schedules,
  constant reporting,  and so on. The agile client has
  a very different relationship with the team.
</div>

<div>
  The agile client trusts
  that the team has done the best they could have done
  to achieve the goals you defined.
</div>

<div>
  The agile client engages in frequent, timely communication
  with the team, defining the
  <a href="#backlog">prioritized backlog</a>,
  <a href="#story-expandsion">expanding stories</a>, 
  <a href="#rescoping">rescoping</a> as necessary,   
  helping select 
  <a href="#plan-b">plan B solutions</a>, and so on.
</div>

<div>
  The agile client expects transparency from the team, in the
  form of <strong>information radiators</strong> such
  as the
  <a href="#task-board">task board</a> and
  <a href="#burnup-chart">burnup chart</a>. The client
  doesn't need to ask the team what they're up to,
  or how things are going. What the team knows, the client can see.
</div>

<div>
  The agile client encourages the team to invest noticeable
  effort to improve the team's development abilities through
  <a href="#health-charts">health charts</a> and
  <a href="#retrospective">retrospectives</a>.
</div>
