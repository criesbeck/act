  <p>I didn't see the point of UCDs at first. The bubbles and stick figures were too simple. The real meat was in the detailed use case texts hidden behind those ovals.</p>

  <p>Then I ran an exercise in a software development class. I told the class to gather the  requirements for a software management application for robotic manufacturing workstations, by interviewing a student who had interned at a company for just such a project the year before.</p>

  <p>The students began asking questions about how the robots worked, what programs were installed and run, and so on. For ten minutes, they drill into the complexities of the coding challenge, until I stopped them.
  "You are going to take forever at this rate, and you're still going to miss some important needs. New goal: create a use case diagram for this system."
  </p>

  <p>Immediately their questions changed. "Who are the users?" "What do they have to be able to do?" "Who's most important?" They quickly discovered two new classes of users, with needs quite different from what had been discussed.</p>

  <p>The use-case diagram led the students to ask far more productive questions, and produce a much clearer document, despite the increase in scope and complexity of their questions.</p>
