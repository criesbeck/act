  The planning meeting that kicks off each iteration is the most critical
  point of interaction between client and developers. It's where clients
  take stock of where things are at, select target stories to be done for the iteration,
  and then define exactly what those stories mean.
</div>

<div>
  <h4>Example</h4>
  <p><em>Skip to My Loo</em>: an app for tourists to find clean public restrooms
    in large cities.
  </p>
  <p><em>Initial Backlog:</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A visitor in Chicago in Millenium Park can see a map of 
      public restrooms near them, with cleanliness ratings.
    </li>
    <li>A visitor in Chicago can give a cleanliness rating, plus
      optional comments, for a  
      public restroom already in the database.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <p>The planning process is not simply deciding what 
    <a href="#user-story">user stories</a> to move from the 
    <a href="#backlog">backlog</a> to the
    <a href="#task-board">task board</a>.
    That way lies disaster. User stories are not requirements. They
    are "tokens for future conversation." That conversation is what must now
    take place, in a process called 
    <a href="#story-expansion">story expansion</a>.

  For clients and developers
  new to agile, a one-week iteration is better. In my courses, I limit teams
  to one-hour iterations, in order to:
  
  <ul>
    <li>reduce meeting fatigue</li>
    <li>force clients and developers to focus and prioritize</li>
    <li>move more content into written form, e.g., emails and shared documents</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Warning:</strong> Iteration planning meetings frequently devolve into     
    a wish-list of
    "nice to have" user stories. The developers get only a vague idea 
    what they need to be working on, and no confidence that they're working on the most
    important thing.      
  <br>Try using <a href="#scenario-canvas">a scenario canvas</a> to
   focus on user stories with real business value.
