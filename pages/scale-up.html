  Claim: "Agile doesn't scale."<br>
  Counterclaim: "Nothing scales."

<div>
  Project complexity grows at least quadratically with the
  number of interconnected parts.
  A 20 person team has 400 paths of communication. 
</div>

<div>
  Software engineers realized long ago that the only way to 
  build large applications with thousands or millions of lines
  of code was encapsulation. Hide most code inside modules.
  Allow very limited channels of communication.

<div>
  Break big project down into
  mostly independent subprojects, small enough for
  a team of 5 developers to handle it. 
  As with <a href="#vertical-slice">slices</a>,
  every subproject should have independent deliverable
  value.<br>

  Example: <strong>Lego Universe</strong> online game: 250 people,
  4 years to first release, shutdown after 2 years.</br>
  <strong>Minecraft</strong>: 2 people, 6 days to first release,
  sold to Microsoft for $2.5 billion.<br>

<div>
  Example: <a href="https://www.cars.com/">cars.com</a> is
  a complex web application for dealers, shoppers, repair sites, and
  others. To allow for agile development, 
  different teams have independent responsibility for different
  slices of value: functions for car dealers, functions for repair sites,
  functions for car shoppers, and so on. Each team owns a slice
  of the web site.

  Coordinating dozens or hundreds of small projects is challenging
  but doable.
  One of the most successful companies at coordinating many agile teams is

<div>
  The worst way to introduce agile into the enterprise:
  <a href="http://dilbert.com/strip/2007-11-26">top-down mandate</a>.
</div>

<div>
  The second worst way to introduce agile: just start doing
  some popular agile activities, e.g., backlogs, iteration planning, and
  daily standups.
</div>

<div>
  Steps in introducing agile to the enterprise:
  <ul>
    <li>Identify a problem with current development processes.</li>
    <li>Measure how bad the problem is. That's your baseline.</li>
    <li>Do a <a href="#cause-effect-diagram">causal analysis</a>.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Propose one or more lightweight easy to try
      agile practices, consistent with the causal analysis
      and readiness of the team.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  Examples of problems:  
  <ul>
    <li>Long time to deliver</li>
    <li>Low quality of code</li>
    <li>Low team morale</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  Examples of causals:
  <ul>
    <li>Slow delivery because of too few skilled
       developers.
    </li>
    <li>Low quality low because of rushed coding</li>
    <li>Low team morale because of frequent weekend work</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  Examples of inconsistent choices of practices: 
  <ul>
    <li>Sending developers out for training to address 
      bottlenecks due to too few skilled developers. Now
      your best developers are even more overworked.
    </li>
    <li>Requiring more testing to address low code quality due to rushed
      code. Now your team is under even greater time pressure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mandating no overtime to address low team morale due to 
      frequent weekend work. Now your team feels worse at how little
      is getting done.
    </li>
  </ul>
