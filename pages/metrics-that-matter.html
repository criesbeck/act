  There are many metrics that be measured in a software project,
  but only a few matter to a project:
  <ul>
    <li>how often new value is delivered</li>
    <li>quality of deliverables</li>
    <li>riskiness of the product and development process</li>
    <li>client's satisfaction with the process</li>
    <li>team morale</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  Metrics like lines of code, hours worked, pages of
  documentation, number of meetings, and so on,
  measure work, not progress.
