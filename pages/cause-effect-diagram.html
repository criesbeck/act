<div>
  A cause-effect diagram is used in 
  <a href="#retrospective">retrospectives</a>
  to analyze the causal forces leading to recurring
  issues in the development process.
</div>

<div>
  The purpose of the diagram is to allow teams to start
  with some repeating event that bothers them, but the
  identify
  <ul>
    <li>the <a href="#metrics-that-matter">metrics that matter</a> that the event affects</li>
    <li>the causal factors that cause the event to repeat</li>
    <li>the best points at which to introduce a process change</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  It's important to move the conversation to the 
  <a href="#metrics-that-matter">metrics that matter</a>.
  Many retrospectives start with obvious issues, such as poor attendance, rambling meetings,
  or ugly code. But those issues must be connected to one or
  more metrics that matter, in order to determine how to prioritize
  when to address the issue, with what level of effort, to what
  level of improvement.

  Henrik Kniberg's article on 
  <a href="https://www.crisp.se/file-uploads/cause-effect-diagrams.pdf">
  cause effect diagrams</a> (PDF) for root cause analysis is
  an excellent tutorial with examples on this tool.
