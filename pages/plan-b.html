<div>
  Most projects trying to build something new
  end up with iterations where nothing gets done, because
  the developers had a story they didn't know how to do,
  or hit a bug they couldn't fix. 
</div>

<div>
  To prevent this, when faced with a problem where the solution
  is not known, the developers and client must agree on a
  Plan B first. Plan B must be some other approach that the developers
  are very confident can be done 
  within the iteration.
</div>

<div>
  There are two ways to use Plan B. One way is to set
  a strict timebox on how long to explore Plan A, before
  switching to Plan B. Enough time has to be left to 
  do Plan B with room to spare. The other way is to do
  Plan B first, and then replace it with Plan A, if
  possible. That's my preference.
