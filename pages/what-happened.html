  <strong>You think:</strong> Those developers really screwed up. Three months claiming they were on-track and they were just wasting time.

<div><strong>Developers think:</strong> We just want to solve problems. Tell us what problem to solve first, and we'll come up with the code to do it.

<div><strong>Reality:</strong> You made at least two big mistakes:
  <ul>
    <li>You let the developers define what was important to build first.</li>
    <li>You accepted a plan that began with months of infrastructure building</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div><strong>What to build first is always a business decision, not a technical one.</strong> 
The business question is "what do we need to know to detect the biggest risks to success?" Those risks might be users don't want what you build, or technology can't do what you need. The right thing to build first is whatever can best start to 
answer those questions. Sometimes you need almost no code at all.
