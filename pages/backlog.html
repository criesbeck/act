  <div>
    A backlog is an ordered list of 
    <a href="#user-story">user stories</a>. The stories may have
    <a href="#story-point">story points</a> attached, to indicate
    expected relative effort. The order of the list is
    the order in which they should be implemented.
  </div>

  <div>
    The backlog is one of the core practices that enables a project
    to be agile. It allows the project to defer commitment on what will be done. 
    This means the stories in the backlog can be updated, replaced, and
  re-ordered, as learning occurs in development and user testing.
</div>  

<div>
  Ordering stories is the core notion. What should be done first?
  Don't hide or defer that decision. 
  Accept that 
  putting one story first increases the risk that other stories 
  won't be done.
</div>

<div>
  Ordering stories is done by the client, based on 
  business needs, not development dependencies. 
  In the early stages of a project, business needs are primarily risk 
  reduction. Will users want this product? Can it do what we claim?
</div>

<div>
  Use the <a href="#kano-model">Kano model</a> concept
  to prioritize stories.
  Start with the delighters. Later, when you have one or more
  validated delighters, focus on the minimum necessary
  items to make a releasable product.
</div>

<div>
  Use 
  <a href="#scenario-canvas">scenario canvases</a>
  to group user stories. Complete one scenario
  before starting another.
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    Agile methods such as <strong>Scrum</strong> 
    start with a larger <strong>release backlog</strong>,
    from which an <strong>iteration backlog</strong>
    is selected.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recommend deferring the release backlog until you've
    had a chance to test and revise your initial
    hypotheses. The release backlog becomes more important
    when you are ready to <a href="#rescoping">manage scope</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Do not</strong> put coding tasks or other activities
  as top level items in the backlog. Make them subtasks of the relevant
  stories. 
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Do not</strong> use priority numbers, or 
  "must have" and "should have" labels. 
  Everything becomes "must have" if you allow that.
</div>


<div>
  <strong>Do not</strong> put due dates on user stories.
  There is no way a developer can guarantee
  any non-trivial task will be done by a date. This is the nature of software
  development. Mandating that a story be done by such and
  such a date does not make it happen, but it does make many
  other bad things happen. 
</div>

<div>
  Project <a href="#deadline-milestone">deadlines</a> are fine.
  Adapt is the scope to make that deadline.
</div>
