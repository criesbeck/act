<div>
This is a toolbox for the software product <strong>client</strong>:
the person with a vision of a product, and 
a team of developers to help build it.
</div>

<div>There are many resources on agile for developers.
Those resources focus on how to deliver value to clients faster
by slicing development tasks into
smaller ones, how to drive robust application development
by writing test code first, how to keep code clean and maintainable
over time through refactoring, and how constantly improve
the team's development process through frequent retrospectives. 
</div>

<div>
There are many resources on agile for project managers, a role
agile dramatically redefines. Those resources on 
focus on servant leadership, removing obstacles, 
using lightweight metrics to identify scope issues,
and so on.
</div>

<div>
The values and principles of agile development apply to
being an agile client, but at the product level. An agile
client needs to know how to slice a large product vision
into a series of small products. To make it harder, the most
valuable slices must come first, so that ideas can be tested with
users to reduce the risk of building an unwanted product.
</div>

<div>
<em>Agile development is a contact sport.</em> An agile client
has to learn how to communicate effectively and constantly with developers,
not about code or technology, but about end user product value.
</div>

<div>
The tools in this toolbox are ideas. Most of these ideas
are simple practices that agile
team have found useful the past 20 years for achieving the primary
goal of agile: delivering value quickly and frequently.
</div>

<div>
Also in the toolbox are some core activities that clients
should engage in frequently with their developers. 
These activities are where 
you work with the developers to make your vision real...
and realistic.
</div>

<div>
Agile is not about using these tools and doing these
activities. You could do all of these things and not be agile.
You could do none of them and still be agile. Agile is 
a mindset that constantly looks for ways in which more
value can be sustainably delivered more frequently.
