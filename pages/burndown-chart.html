<div>
  A burndown chart displays progress in completing ("burning")
  <a href="#story-point">story points</a>
  for the current release.
</div>

<div>
  The primary purpose of the chart is to 
  show at a glance whether the hoped-for release
  is feasible, or will have to be 
  <a href="#rescoping">rescoped</a>.
</div>

<div>
  A burndown chart can mislead. Lack of apparent progress
  in reducing story points might be because development slowed.
  But it just as easily could be because scope increased.
</div>

<div>
  The <a href="#burnup-chart">burnup chart</a> uses
  the same data as the burnup chart, but separates
  out velocity versus scope.
